# transmission_valuation
I analyze the value of transmission from Pacific Northwest to Northern California for a utility or any energy market participant. The analysis is based on the difference between energy prices at mid-Columbia and NP-15 hubs.

The "data" folder contains the day ahead market (DAM) and fifteen minute market (FMM) prices for 1 year.

presentation.Rmd builds the presentation using the data in the "data" folder and styles.css for font color and style.

presentation_with_widgets.Rmd inserts the widgets of each plot and table from the project folder. It does not import or analyze data.
